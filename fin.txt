Is widespread antibiotic use having effects
on the formation and dynamics of the lung
microbiome? At this point, it is clear that we
just do not know. Antibiotics could affect
the lung microbiome either directly through
their selective force, or indirectly through
effects on the gut microbiome and its
downstream effects on immunity. Our
“other” genome, as the human microbiome
has been considered, is facing an era of
major changes, induced by lifestyle, diet,
and antibiotic use. The use of culture-
independent 16S rRNA and metagenomic
approaches provides a new vision to our
understanding of the lung as a unique
mucosal niche exposed to a complex
microbial environment. We are just
learning about associations involving the
microbiome of the gastrointestinal tract and
the airways, as well as the immunological
consequences of the human microbiome.
The combination of modern changes in
microbial environment and technological
developments that allow understanding the
human microbiome provides a unique
opportunity to explore mechanisms of
disease in this brave new world
